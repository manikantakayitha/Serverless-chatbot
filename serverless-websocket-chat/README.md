# Serverless WebSocket chat example

This is a Serverless project which creates a websocket chat backend. It's quite basic, but supports
some standard features including setting a nickname, multiple channels, and broadcasting messages
to channel members. The coolest this is that this is entirely serverless and in Python!

## Getting started

This can all be deployed with AWS SAM.

```bash
$ sam build
$ sam deploy --guided
```

The final output will be a `wss` endpoint which you can connect to:

```
